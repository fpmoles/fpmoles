## About Me
I am a software engineer and architect who has spent a large portion of my 20+ year career building distributed platforms on both public and private clouds. I love working with computers in general, but solving real problems that impact real people really makes me love my job even more. My experiences and tenure affords me the greatest of opporutnities, and that is mentoring and teaching. I have many courses on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/frank-p-moley-iii) and often use my personal GitHub repos to explain software problems and solutions through my Kata exercises. I also speak at conferences and use my talks- repos to share the information from my presentations.
